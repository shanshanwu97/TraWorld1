<p>Hi Patrick!<br>Thank you for your articles, I retweet as I can your works through my microblog about conversational chat apps: <br><a href="http://www.twitter.com/solyarisoftware" rel="nofollow">www.twitter.com/solyarisoftwar...</a></p><p>I read with pleasure your successive article about customizing:<br><a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/customizing-your-api-ai-assistant-with-intent-and-context/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sitepoint.com/custo...</a></p><p>I appreciate your step-by-step "user manual" graphical style! Very clear for beginners (as me).<br>Minor points: maybe articles become a bit long in this way. Generally speaking, my side, I'd appreciate also some digression about your point of view on <a href="http://api.ai/" rel="nofollow">API.ai</a> NLP "conceptuals approach".</p><p>At first glance, <a href="http://api.ai/" rel="nofollow">API.ai</a> appears to me a good compromise!<br> Waiting to retweet your next blog article about these topics!<br>Thanks <br>giorgio</p>

<p>Grazie Giorgio! I appreciate you taking the time to write :)</p><p>Feel free to retweet and share the article to anyone who might be interested in getting into the basics of AI — that's what these articles are for!</p><p>I agree that articles can become a little long with my step-by-step approach, but I've chosen that to ensure it's as clear as possible. I figure, if people understand some of the steps intuitively, they'll scroll past them faster anyway. If someone is really confused about a step, sometimes having a lot of detail can really help. To counter it being too long, I've tried to separate each article into concepts (like how my next article was about customization). Hoping that helps prevent them getting *too* long!</p><p>I might actually write an opinion piece on the different types of approaches to starting in AI on Dev Diner at some point, as it is a topic many have brought up. Some commenters don't feel that <a href="http://api.ai/" rel="nofollow">Api.ai</a> is truly AI at all, whilst others (like me) disagree and see it as a nice simple stepping stone to the more complicated stuff.</p><p>Ah... the more complicated stuff. I'm actually really looking forward to exploring that in months to come here at SitePoint ;)</p>

<p>Thanks Patrick <br>I retweet your post through my tweetter page as soon you will publish :)</p><p>About the value of tools as <a href="http://api.ai/" rel="nofollow">API.ai</a> / <a href="http://wit.ai/" rel="nofollow">WIT.ai</a>, <br>me too, I feel are a good way to implement what i call "deterministic goals", I'm focused on using NLP to implement ecommerce / any service upon instant messaging and I feel the entities/intents/context are a suitable way to achive precise tasks/goals as submitting an online order, booking something, etc.<br>I point out this on reply to Manisha Singh (my comment under moderation).</p><p>So <a href="http://api.ai/" rel="nofollow">API.ai</a> seems great, but there is a probelm with data... specifically: "user entities" because in case of a ecommerce / profit / person profiling agent; data are shared with <a href="http://api.ai/" rel="nofollow">API.ai</a> and that's bad in my opinion.</p><p>A possible solution I'm looking for is something like <a href="http://api.ai/" rel="nofollow">API.ai</a> but as an open source prject, where the NLP <a href="http://api.ai/" rel="nofollow">API.ai</a>-like engine could be installe on private server ...</p><p>Any idea ?</p><p>respect<br>giorgio</p>

<p>Thanks for the great introduction to personal assistants, this is the future! I'm trying to look for tutorials showing how to use <a href="http://api.ai/" rel="nofollow">api.ai</a> inside small apps (unfortunately there doesn't seem to be much at all online), for example a receipe app, the user queries "how do you make spanish omelettes" it will look through the app's database and return the relevant fragment/activity to the user. Have you come across anything like that?</p>

<p>I think each service will be good for different people. For me, <a href="http://api.ai/" rel="nofollow">Api.ai</a> and <a href="http://wit.ai/" rel="nofollow">Wit.ai</a> are much easier to get started with, despite depending on one particular service. Sirius requires developers to set it up in Ubuntu and Melissa-AI works with OS X and Linux. That's a much bigger barrier to entry than a ready made service that you can get started with straight away in the cloud.</p><p>I've got plans to explore some of the other options which involve that level of set up in future demos but I'd prefer to cover some of these services first. <a href="http://api.ai/" rel="nofollow">Api.ai</a> is great for its initial simplicity and huge amounts of functionality out of the box.</p>

<p>Hi Giorgio,</p><p>I think "better" is a relative term here.  What I think for serious developers (that wouldn't be me) it  offers a "better" opportunity for scale and customization.  I think <a href="http://api.ai/" rel="nofollow">API.ai</a> is a great entry product FOR someone like me to play with, but when I concept really complex things, I think Sirus stands taller for that.  So...no, I can't give you any docs..but someone else may be able to direct you in this thread...</p>

<p>Hi,<br>I'm perplex because, reading some Sirius documentations / slides / tutorials, I didn't found there any available conceptual precise dialog modelization approach, and/or any software implementation already done to realize a dialog system engine. It seems to me a reasearch university project more related to image recognition, maybe.</p><p>So I have difficulties to understand why we could just compare Sirius with <a href="http://api.ai/" rel="nofollow">API.ai</a> (stating that the first one is better/for more complex tasks, than the second...).</p><p>BTW, my proposal of a open-source #API_ai system here:<br><a href="http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/questions/28426/open-source-dialog-system-natural-language-processing-engine" rel="nofollow">http://softwarerecs.stackexcha...</a></p><p>thanks<br>giorgio</p>

<p>Hi Manisha<br>I thank you for links about Sirius and Melissa; I don't know these and I just read some docs on link you propse,</p><p>nevertheless your statement about the fact Sirius and Melissa "are much better than <a href="http://api.ai/" rel="nofollow">API.ai</a>" could be "demonstrated"/proved.</p><p>Why do you are so sure that these systems are better ? <br>May you please suggest a link/paper/article to understand what's the Sirius/Melissa conceptual aproach and why a possible more "general" AI approach, abstract from the SERVICE, could be better that a service-oriented NLP approach ?</p><p>I'm telling this because, I'm studying how to organize a dev platform infrastucture (from the developer perspective) to realize chatbots / conversational application apps for BUSINESS SERVICES (that are the 2016 HUGE trend, IMMO);</p><p>I'm almost convinced that, in tis contexts,  NLP strategy is NOT to supply a general siri-aptana like assistant SDKs (I call this a "top-down" AI approach),</p><p>BUT instead are maybe more pragmatic SW platforms that realize "quickly" what I call "DETERMINISTIC" conversational apps, that means: chatbot conversations to bring user to complete some precise "business" action e.g. ecommerce, epayment, etc.,</p><p>I specifically think about a conversational online shopping scenario (#ConvComm) where a buyer on a chat want to purchase converstating with a chat bot. In this case, the chatbot "goal" is mainly to drive user to complete an online ORDER (the "deterministic" goal).</p><p>Anyway, may you please explain (with examples), about Sirius/Melissa approachs:<br>1. What are these approaches (from the semantic/tech point of view)<br>2. Where are the APIs ?</p><p>Looking forward your points<br>respect<br>giorgio</p>
